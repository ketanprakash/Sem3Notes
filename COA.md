### Computer Architecture

> What makes one computer faster/more performant than other?
> Architectural differences make one computer faster/more performant than other.

> What is Computer Architecture?
> Computer Architecture deals with the funcational behaviour of a computer system and its optimization for a task for which is to be used.  

* Deals with the **functional behaviour** of a computer system.

* To provide **optimum performance** in the context of the uses to which it will be put. 

* Can be seen as a **constraint** optimization problem. This contraint can be **cost**, **system size**, **thermal/mechanical durability**, etc.

* Constaints are made concrete by a set of **performance indicators**. Eg : Processing speed, Graphics speed, etc. 

### Computer Organization

<!-- * Computer organization deals with the implementation of computer architecture at a hardware.  -->

* Computer Organization can be seen as a microarchitecture (logic/hardware implementation)
